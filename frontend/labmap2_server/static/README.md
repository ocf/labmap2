# Labmap2

Labmap2 is a full rewrite of the OCF's labmap project, including new features and fixing old issues with
the software. This program uses a combination of systems and languages in order to achieve the goal
of having up-to-date information as well as the ability to make changes to the arrangement of the 
devices in the OCF. Furthermore, the ability to customize setups in addition to each users avatars or
"Waddles" is possible with this new version of Labmap.

For more information about the scope of the project, please see the labmap2\_diagram included on the
root directory of this git repo.
